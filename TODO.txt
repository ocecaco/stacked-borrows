More speculative:
- Can the separate private/local things be better integrated to the notion of a "private location" for the purposes of stating lemmas about them?
  Basically, can "protected" become another state of the tag? How can we make sure a call ID protects nothing when EndCall happens?
  Or will that just always be `own_local loc tag \/ (exists cid h, own_call_id cid h /\ h !! loc = Some tag)`?

Things in the "model" side:
- Can we get rid of this EndCall-based stack tracking?  Would be nice to treat EndCall more like InitCall, as part of the body of the fn, instead of special-casing it so much.
