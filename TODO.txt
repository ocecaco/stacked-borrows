Change retag semantics! Don't prove anything about this crazy monster.

Things in the "logical" side of the model that could be made better:
- The invariant for one (sub-)resource should only talk about that resource.
  To fix CallMapInv: replace set T by `gmap loc tag` indicating which locations are protected.
  To fix TagMapInv: kill the "value" part of LMAP.
  To fix LocMapInv: make it a `gmap loc tag` that all just have a singleton stack with that loc.
  Then we can also make PrivLoc handle fairly uniformly locations that are "privatized" by being protected or by being local.
- heaplets need to map to *pairs of* scalars: left val, right val. Remove silly equality from LmapInv.
- lmap needs to become `gmap tag (ex (gset loc))` so that we can make local locations public and know that this does not de-privatize any other location.
  or maybe instead just make it a different state that a tag can be in? pub, uniq, local? Seems more reasonable at this point.
- No need for (persistently) public call IDs.  Still need to be able to pass
  ownership of *all* tag protected by a call ID though, so
  `gmap call_id (ex (gmap tag loc))` seems reasonable, or else `gmap call_id (prod frac (gmap tag (ex loc)))`.
- Free and Retag should be WF!

More speculative:
- Can the separate private/local things be better integrated to the notion of a "private location" for the purposes of stating lemmas about them?
  Basically, can "protected" become another state of the tag? How can we make sure a call ID protects nothing when EndCall happens?
  Or will that just always be `own_local loc tag \/ (exists cid h, own_call_id cid h /\ h !! loc = Some tag)`?

Things in the "model" side:
- Can we get rid of this EndCall-based stack tracking?  Would be nice to treat EndCall more like InitCall, as part of the body of the fn, instead of special-casing it so much.
